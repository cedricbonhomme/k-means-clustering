# Presentation

A recommender using K-Means clustering with the distance of Pearson.

# Usage

## Generation of the vectors

    $ ./generate_vectors.py --help
    Usage: generate_vectors.py [window_min] [window_max] [service_url]
    $ ./generate_vectors.py
    vectors saved

*generate_vectors.py* retrieves informations about objects to recommend through
the API in order to generate vectors based on different properties of an object
(abstract, resume and title). The vectors will be stored in a simple text file.

The size of the window will have an impact on the size of the vectors and
consequently an important impact on the boundaries between the clusters.

## Generation of the clusters

    $ ./generate_clusters.py --help
    Usage: generate_clusters.py nb_cluster
    $ ./generate_clusters.py 15
    Iteration 0
    Iteration 1
    Iteration 2
    Iteration 3
    clusters saved

*generate_clusters.py* launches the clustering process. Clusters are set of id.

* More clusters generated means more iterations for less recommendations
and better recommendations.
* Less clusters generated means less iterations for more recommendations
and less relevant recommendations.

For more clusters and to keep a good quality we need to have more and bigger
vectors.

## List the generated clusters

    $ ./list_clusters.py
    Cluster 0:
    ['55e450a0c20c4956ee6f2c49', '55e450a0c20c4956ee6f2c4c', '55e450a0c20c4956ee6f2c4a']
    Cluster 1:
    ['55f67917c20c4930de8655ff', '55f67916c20c4930de8655ea', '55f67917c20c4930de865601']
    Cluster 2:
    ['55e450a0c20c4956ee6f2c48', '55e450a0c20c4956ee6f2c4b']
    Cluster 3:
    ['55e450a0c20c4956ee6f2c46']

## Recommend something for a user

    $ ./recommend.py 55f6791ac20c4930e106f2f6 recommender_nickname recommender_password [service_url]
    ['55f67917c20c4930de8655ff', '55f67916c20c4930de8655ea', '55f67917c20c4930de865601']
    Profile updated.

The user has previously added the object *55f67916c20c4930de8655ea* in its
program. Based on the clustering done previously we recommend to this
user 2 other objects.

The message *'Profile updated'* means that the profile has been updated.

The second argument is the nickname of the recommender. The third argument is
the password. Only use a user with the *recommender* role!

# TODO

* add a client for ZeroMQ.
